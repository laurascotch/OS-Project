## What's this project?
This very simple unix shell was developed as an assignment for the Operative System Course at University of Trento. The main goal was to understand and achieve process piping.

### Project development
We worked in a group of 4 students and we had three weeks to deliver the project (it wasn't easy...). 
Each of us focused on a different task, while meeting every two or three days in order to explain the updates. 

## Future implementations
I'm aware that there are some things that are still missing (some commands are still not supported and just make the shell crash), and I plan to fix everything as a personal goal in the future.
Any feedback would be much appreciated!

Thank you for reading.
